# About Lockdown Mode

iOS 16 introduced [_Lockdown Mode_](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212650). It disables or restricts some system features in order to reduce the chance that advanced spyware exploits any of them to infect a aystem. Apple has [documented](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120) what settings Lockdown Mode disables. It's worth checking this documentation whenever new iOS versions come out, as Lockdown Mode's functioning has changed slightly between them.
As far as we know, Lockdown Mode does not currently interfere with basic or advanced forensics processes, including MVT. If it's been turned on, there is no need to turn it off prior to running any forensics processes.
